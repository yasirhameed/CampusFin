          <p>Teaching people about software product design and development is important to us. This includes answering all sorts of questions. So, here's what most people ask us starting from when should they choose us, type of works we do or how the process goes into a product.</p>

                  <p>We have always kept in mind the fact that we live in a world of technology, which is why we have incorporated it into our work. Agile is a flashy phrase; however, some of our teams will be similar to Scrum teams with conventional ceremonies. We are fully committed to Lean and Lean Startup principles such as people over process and validated learning through experimentation. Frequently, at clients’ premises or remotely, we employ scaled agile approaches like SAFe.</p>

                    We bring on board developers who can program in different languages and for various platforms after hiring them as generalists. The common technologies employed these days comprise .NET, Java, C++, React, AWS, Azure, Android and Python. We also have time to handle IOT and different embedded systems too. One can consult our Tech Details page containing all the programming languages and technologies used in recent product development initiatives.

                    Sure! Full-stack engineers are our kind. Rather than breaking down our developers into “front-end only” or “back-end only” roles, we do it differently.

                    Of course, it does. This is a must for the success of any software application before its launch with Quality Assurance and Testing.

                    Chances are that your software does not have bugs is very minimal. Why? Its development involves people who can make mistakes. There exist numerous functioning parts in even the simplest part of a software application which in turn contains multiple lines of intricate code. The creation of bugs may be due to poor integration among individual units at times leading to this situation. Therefore, QA & testing must happen.
